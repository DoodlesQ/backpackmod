Genuine Backpacks is a mod that adds backpacks to Minecraft.
These backpacks can be freely colored and renamed, and can be upgraded to larger storage sizes using a new workstation, the Sewing Table.

## Getting Started

### Sewing Table

The **Sewing Table** is the core of the mod, which can be used to craft and upgrade all backpacks.

![The Sewing Table is crafted with a 2x2 formation of wooden planks, with one stick and one leather placed above them.](https://i.ibb.co/xtsjJ7WK/modgbcraftsewtab.png)

To use the Sewing Table, you must supply it with both a *spool of thread* and a pair of shears.
Every crafting recipe will consume one spool and damage the shears used, so be sure to keep well stocked!

### Spool of Thread

The next most important item is the **Spool of Thread**, used both as the catalyst for all sewing recipes and as an ingredient.

### Bound Leather and Tanned Leather

Backpacks are crafted using **Tanned Leather**, but to make it you must first craft **Bound Leather**.

![Bound Leather is crafted simply by one leather into a sewing table.](https://i.ibb.co/TxFjns7Y/modgbcraftboulea.png)
![Tanned Leather is crafted by smelting bound leather in a furnace.](https://i.ibb.co/Xxh0rC0z/modgbcrafttanlea.png)

### Backpacks

To create a **Backpack**, you can use any color of wool you like.

![A Backpack is crafted by placing five tanned leather and three wool of any single color into a sewing table.](https://i.ibb.co/Y7Cj4Q1S/modgbcraftback0.gif)

<ins>Right-click</ins> a backpack to open it, or wear it on your back and press the <ins>backpack key</ins> (default 'B').

<ins>Shift + Right-click</ins> to place a backpack in the world, where it can be opened by any player.

Alternatively, <ins>Shift + Right-click</ins> while looking in the air to open the *rename menu*, to rename your backpack without requiring an anvil.

Backpacks can be further dyed in a crafting table, or re-stitched with new wool.

![Dyeing a backpack works identically to dyeing leather armor -- combining it with any amount of dyes in a crafting table.](https://i.ibb.co/xSzr2pwh/modgbcraftdye0.gif)
![Backpacks can be restitched by combining them with 3 wool of any single color in a sewing table. This returns the backpack to that wool's basic color.](https://i.ibb.co/gbrbYVHw/modgbcraftstitch0.gif)

### Backpack Pockets

There are three sizes of pocket: **Small**, **Medium**, and **Large**. Each can expand your backpack's storage capacity a small amount, from 18 slots up to 63 -- a full double-chest's worth!

![Pockets are crafted in a sewing table using tanned leather and a valuable item. Small requires one leather and an iron ingot, medium needs two leather and a gold ingot, and large needs three leather and a diamond.](https://i.ibb.co/SwJdwHL2/modgbcraftpocket0.gif) 

Pockets can then be combined with a backpack in a sewing table in order to apply them.

Each pocket has a different size bonus and maximum quantity.

| Pocket | Extra Slots | Max Count |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Small | 3 | 3 |
| Medium | 6 | 3 |
| Large | 9 | 2 |

### Ender Backpack

The **Ender Backpack** allows you to access your ender chest on the go! It can be worn, placed, and renamed just like any other backpack.
